This is the Docker container I use for development. It comes preloaded with APT packages that I use as well as a variety of configurations that I like my environemnt to have.

To build the container:

```shell
$ docker build -t devenv                      \
               --build-arg USERNAME=$(whoami) \
               --build-arg UID=$(id -u)       \
               --build-arg GID=$(id -g) .
```

-- or --

```
$ ./build_container.sh
```

Note: There is a hardcoded value in `enter_container.sh` (the `-v` option).
Modify it to your liking; same with the packages in `Dockerfile`.
